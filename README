Search Movies:
	java Movies -Xmx1024m
Search Actors:
	java Actors -Xmx2048m
	
	For the movies, I used an inverted index on each keyword that is in the title. I saved
the line numbers in an ArrayList. When a keyboard is searched, the movie at that line is
outputted.
	
	For actors, I used a HashMap keeping the actor name in the as the key and the movies as 
value. The movies are stored as one large string to reduce the overhead of multiple objects
